# Hello-World

Hello World!

My name is Leigha and I love ice skating, ice cream, and big floofy doggos!
I'm a dual citizen and I recently moved from Canada to be closer to Family in the USA.
Jeni's ice cream is my current favourite place to get a sweet treat.
I have a soft spot for Labradors but right now Samoyed dogs are my favourite. 
I attribute my new found love of the Samoyed breed to the absolute cuteness found on the youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnjyiWHGEyww-p8QYSftx2A
